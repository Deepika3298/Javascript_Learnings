//Before 1995, Jvascript has one part called layout engines- present in browsers and convert html and css of downloaded file(of website) to show layout of website examples-blink in chrome,opera and gecko in firefox and trident in edge
//in 1995,brendan eich (worked in netscape) created javascript and said browser has 2 parts- layout engine(for html and css files) and javascript engine or interpreter(for .js files). js engine consists console and DOM(document object model) and BOM(browser object model)
//DOM is a javascript object through which we can edit html of a page and available as object- document 
//BOM is avaliable as object-window and all our code run in BOM.
//chromium-open source browser on which chrome is built(chrome=chromium+google stuff)
//chromium-blink(layout engine) and V8(js engine)  
//in starting javascript was used for small events due to slow speed and formely js code was written only for browsers
//in 2005-2006, google made its own browser(chrome) due to low speed of internet-first blink then v8.
//In 2009, ryan dahl make chromium v8 engine code to work in computer-it consists terminal(inplace of console), dom is absent, global object in place of bom window object.he also add some more features like network,file system and https,etc[combinely called node.js]
 //WORE or WORA ecosystem (write once run everywhere or anywhere)-js file can be written once and can be  implemented on any node.js (may be linux,windows,mac)
 //Centralised package manager- in node.js-npm and yarn-programs through which we can install node.js programs into our computer and also load node.js libraries into our programs and node.js executable-javascript file runs via node.
 //To read and write file  operation can only be done in node.js not in browsers.
